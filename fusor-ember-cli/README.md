# fuser-ember-cli

This repo is the development environment to create [FusorUi](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/ui/) which a rails engine that is added to [Foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/).

[FusorUi](https://github.com/fusor/ui/) is essentially the output from this repo which is an [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) project that contains assets such as javascript, stylesheets, images, and fonts.

## Important Note

The fuser-ember-cli/dist directory is the [.gitignore](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/blob/master/.gitignore) so you wont find it in this repository.

The fuser-ember-cli/dist distory is generated automatically by [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) when you run `ember server` or `ember build` locally inside the this directory.

## Workflow

1. Clone [fusor](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/) to your local workstation.
2. `cd fusor-ember-cli`
3. Run `ember server`
4. Prepare for development
  - In [controllers/application.js](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/blob/master/fusor-ember-cli/app/controllers/application.js#L8), change `deployAsPlugin` from `true` to `false`
  - In [styles/app.scss](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/tree/master/fusor-ember-cli/app/styles/app.scss#L3), change `padding-top` from `40px` to `0px`
5. HAPPY HACKING!
6. Prepare for copying compiled ember-cli output code to [FusorUi](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/ui/) plugin
  - In [controllers/application.js](https://github.com/fusor/fusor-ember-cli/blob/master/app/controllers/application.js#L8), change `deployAsPlugin` from `false` to `true`
  - In [styles/app.scss](https://github.com/fusor/fusor-ember-cli/blob/master/app/styles/app.scss#L3), change `padding-top` from `0px` to `40px`
  - Run bash script [`./prep-fusor-repo`](https://github.com/fusor/fusor-ember-cli/blob/master/prep-fusor-repo) which copies files from `fusor/fusor-ember-cli/dist` to the `fusor/ui` repo
